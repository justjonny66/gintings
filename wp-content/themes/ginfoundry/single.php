			<p>We questioned everything. Why go with a 70cl bottle? Why use local botanicals? Why have a round bottle? There is a danger in just going with the crowd. One of our earliest decisions was to stay away from local botanicals. Mostly they are used not for flavour, but for marketing purposes. Sure it makes cute copy, but it’s become a cliché. When we found one of the largest shippers of spices in the Victorian period was White’s of Waterford and they used to ship botanicals up the Blackwater River to all the big houses – it was just too compelling to ignore. </p>
			<p>It gave us a local angle and a real story not some nonsense about grubbing around in the hedgerows or picking shamrocks. If you want to use local botanicals then do it properly. Be brave. That’s why in 2016 we will pilot a 100% Native Irish Gin where local botanicals aren’t PR dressing, the gin will actually be made from 100% Irish botanicals and 100% Irish spirit. We questioned everything. Why go with a 70cl bottle? Why use local botanicals? Why have a round bottle?</p>
